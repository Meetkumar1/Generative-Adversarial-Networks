# Generative-adversarial-networks

## Dataset:
The CIFAR-10 dataset. It consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
It is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class.

## Project Description
Generated new images from Deep Convolutional GANs (i.e., Generative adversarial networks).

The 'Results' Directory contains the newly generated images from DCGAN.
